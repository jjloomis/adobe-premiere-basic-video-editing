# Creating a black background screen with white text over it

1. [Create a new title](/adding-titles.html).
2. In the Title Properties area, check `Background`. This will create a black background in the Title.

3. Add your text as you would when [creating a title](/adding-titles.html). Note: For a "credits" screen, you will want to center \(and center justify\) your text.
