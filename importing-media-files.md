# Importing media files

Before you can start editing, youâ€™ll need to import your media files into your Premiere project. 

After you import your media files into your Premiere project, they will appear as clips in the Project panel.

1. If you have not already done so, copy all of your media files into your project folder (see previous the section, "Setting up your project.") If you don't copy your media files into your project folder, you will lose your media files and your Premiere project will not work.
2. In your Premiere project, go to File on the menu bar and choose Import.
3. Navigate to your project folder and the select the media files you would like to Import. You may need to drill down in the folder tree to you find your media files. \(Note: You can Command-click multiple media files to select several at the same time.\)
4. Click Import. Your media files will appear as clips the Project panel.
