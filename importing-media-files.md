# Importing media files

Before you can edit your media files, youâ€™ll need to import them into your Premire project. Once imported, your media files will appear as clips in the Project panel.

1. If you have not already done so, copy all of your media files into your project folder. Note: If you do not copy your media files into your project folder, you will lose your media files. Your Premiere project will not work.
2. In your Premiere project, go to `File` on the menu bar and choose `Import`.
3. Navigate to your project folder and the select the media files you would like to import. You may need to drill down in the folder tree to find your media files. Press `Command` \(on keyboard\) to select multiple media files.
4. Click `Import`. Your media files will appear as clips the Project panel.
