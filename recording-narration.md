# Recording narration

When the script is complete and your editor has reviewed it, youâ€™re ready to record narration.

1. Connect the stick mic in camera kit to **Channel 1** \(on camera.\) **Note**: You don't need to connect the shotgun mic to the camera.
2. Turn camera on and press **Record** button. 
3. Read your narration script into the stick mic. 
4. When finished, press the **Record** button to stop recording. 
5. [Copy the media files from the video camera into your class folder](/adding-media-from-a-video-camera.md).
6. [Import the media files into your project](/importing-media-files.md).
7. Add your narration clips \(audio portion only\) to your sequence just as you would any other media file. **Note**: Narration and interview clips need to go in the **A1** audio channel.
