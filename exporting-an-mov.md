# Exporting an MOV

You’ll export an MOV file as your finished product. You can upload this MOV file to YouTube or Vimeo.

1. Important: Make sure you have the Timeline area selected before exporting your video (click in Timeline area—Timeline area will have a yellow border around it.) If you have only one clip selected in the Project window, Premiere will export only that clip (not your entire project.)
2. Go to File on the menu bar. Select Export. From the fly-out menu, select Media.
3. In the Export dialog box, under in the Format drop-down list, select QuickTime.
4. In the Source Range drop-down list, choose Entire Sequence.
5. To specify the name and location of your exported video, click the Output Name. A Save As dialog box will appear. Rename your video. In the Where field, specify where your finished video will appear when Adobe Premiere has finished exporting it. Click Save. (Note: Do not change the File Format in the Save As dialog box.)
6. Click Export.
