# Adding a cross dissolve

1. Go to `Window` on the menu bar and select `Effects`. The Effects tab will display in the Project panel.
2. In the Effects window, click the `expand` button (triangle) next to Video Transitions.
3. Click and drag the Cross Dissolve icon to the area where you would like the transition to appear (either the beginning or end of a clip, or between two clips.) You will see the Cross Dissolve on the clip (or clips) in the Timeline.
4. To adjust the duration of the Cross Dissolve, press `Control` (on keyboard) and click the transition in the Timeline. In the fly-out menu, choose `Set Transition Duration`.
5. In the Set Transition Duration dialog box, enter a new duration for your transition. Note: The duration time format is `Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Frames`.
6. Click `OK` to apply the new Transition duration. Repeat this process for other Cross Dissolve transitions as you see fit.
