# Creating an overlay edit

1. Make sure the Selection Tool is selected in the Tool window.
2. Click the video portion of a clip in the Timeline.
3. Drag the video portion of the clip upwards in the video track area of the Timeline. The video and audio portions of the clip will separate—each moving towards the top and bottom of the Timeline, respectively.
4. Position the video of the overlay clip above the video of another clip in the Timeline. The video of the overlay clip will play in the Program window while the audio of clip beneath it plays as well.
