# Duplicating a title

1. Locate the Title you would like to duplicate in the Project panel.
2. Press Control (on keyboard) and click the Title. In the fly-out menu, choose Duplicate.
3. A duplicate of the original Title will appear in the Project panel. Rename the duplicate.
4. In the Project panel, double-click the duplicate title. The Title window will open.
5. In the Title window, make modifications to the text, etc.
6. When finished, close the Title window (your changes are automatically saved.)
7. To add your title to your project, click and drag the title still from the Project window to your Timeline. The title should be in the topmost video track.
9. Adjust the duration of the title just as you would a video clip (click and drag beginning or end of title still in the Timeline.)
10. Add a Cross Dissolve transition to the beginning and end of the title still in the Timeline. (Note: you will probably need to adjust the duration of the crossfade on your title still.)
