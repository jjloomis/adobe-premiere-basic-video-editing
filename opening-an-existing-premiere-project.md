# Opening an existing Premiere project

Connecting to your class folder and double-clicking your project's PRPROJ file will, unfortunatlely, not immediately open your project. The most effective way to open in a Premiere project is to use the `File` `Open Project` method \(outlined here.\)

1. Connect to your class folder using a JAMS Lab or CCL Mac.
2. Open Premiere.
3. In Premiere, click `File` on the menu bar.
4. From the fly-out menu, choose `Open Project`.
5. Navigate to and select your Premier project file \(PRPROJ\).
6. Click `Open`.
