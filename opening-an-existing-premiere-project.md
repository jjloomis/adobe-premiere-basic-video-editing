# Opening an existing Premiere project

Connecting to your class folder and double-clicking your project's PRPROJ file will not immediately open your project. The most effective way to open in a Premiere project is to use the **File** **Open Project** method \(outlined here\).

1. Connect to your class folder using a JAMS Lab or CCL Mac.
2. Open Premiere.
3. In Premiere, click **File** on the menu bar.
4. From the fly-out menu, choose **Open Project**.
5. Navigate to and select your Premier project file \(PRPROJ\).
6. Click **Open**.
