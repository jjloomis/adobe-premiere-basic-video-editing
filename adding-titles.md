# Adding titles

1. On the menu bar, go to Title, New Title. From the fly-out menu, choose Default Still.
2. A settings box will appear. Click OK.
3. A Title window will appear. You will use this box to create a title still (similar to a transparent image) that will appear in your Project window (along with your video clips.)
4. Make sure the Type tool is selected. Click on video image in the Title window. A cursor will appear. Add your title text here (there is no spell check, so double-check your spelling and grammar.)
5. To change your title text font, drag-select your text. Then, in the Title Styles area, select a new font and format for your title.
6. To reposition your title text, click the Selection Tool (Note: Be sure to click the Selection Tool in the Title window tools area.) With the Selection Tool active, click and drag your title text to reposition it. (Note: All of your text should be within the title safe area—the inner lines in the title preview box.)
7. When you’re finished creating your title, close the Title window. You will see a title added to your Project window (it will probably be named “Title 01.”)
8. To add your title to your project, click and drag the title still from the Project window to your Timeline. The title should be in the topmost video track.
9. Adjust the duration of the title just as you would a video clip (click and drag beginning or end of title still in the Timeline.)
10. Add a Cross Dissolve transition to the beginning and end of the title still in the Timeline. (Note: you will probably need to adjust the duration of the crossfade on your title still.)
