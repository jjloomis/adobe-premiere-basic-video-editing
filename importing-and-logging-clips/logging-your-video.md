# Logging your video

Logging your video means carefully watching and taking notes on all the interviews, B-roll and natural sound you shot.

On a Word doc, write the time code \(the location\) of everything you have to work with so it’s easy to find later.

Loosely transcribe \(write out word for word\) your best possible sound bites. Watch and listen for “pops” of natural sound you may want to include in your story.
