# Importing media files

Before you can edit your media files, you’ll need to import them into your Premire project. Once imported, your media files will appear as clips in the Project panel.

Note: Always use list view in the Finder window when importing media files.

1. If you have not already done so, copy all of your media files into your project folder. Note: If you do not copy your media files into your project folder, you will lose your media files. Your Premiere project will not work.
2. In your Premiere project, go to **File** on the menu bar and choose **Import**.
3. Navigate to your project folder and the select the media files you would like to import. **Note**: If you[ copied an AVCHD folder from a Canon video camera](../setting-up-your-project/adding-media-from-a-video-camera.md) into your project folder, the path to the MTS files is: `Renamed-AVCHD-folder/BDMV/STREAM`. **Command-click files** to select more than one at a time.
4. Click **Import**. Your media files will appear as clips the Project panel.
