# Panels are in Weird Places

If your Premiere panels (**Source**, **Program**, **Project**, etc.) are in weird places, you may have accidentally selected a different **Workspace**. A **Workspace** is an arrangement of panels that is optimized for a particular task (audio editing, for example.)

* Click **Window** in the menu bar and select **Workspaces**. In the fly-out menu, choose a **Workspaces**. (**Editing**, **Effects**, and **Captions and Graphics** are the **Workspaces** most often used in JAMS courses.)   &#x20;
