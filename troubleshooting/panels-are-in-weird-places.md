# Panels are in Weird Places

If your Premiere panels \(Source, Program, Project, etc.\) are in weird places, you may have accidentally selected a different Workspace. A Workspace is an arragnement of panels that is optimized for a particular task \(audio editing, for example.\)

* In the Workspaces bar \(top\) click **Editing**, **Effects**, or **Graphics**. \(These are the Workspaces most often used in JAMS courses.\)
