# Panels are in Weird Places

If your Premiere panels (Source, Program, Project, etc.) are in weird places, you may have accidentally selected a different Workspace. A Workspace is an arragnement of panels that is optimized for a particular task (audio editing, for example.)

* In the Workspaces bar (top) click **Editing**, **Effects**, or **Graphics**. (These are the Workspaces most often used in JAMS courses.)
