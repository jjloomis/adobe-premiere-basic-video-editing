# A Panel is Missing or Looks Different

If a panel is missing or looks different, a tab within the panel may have been clicked by accident.

1. Make sure you have the [correct Workspace selected](panels-are-in-weird-places.md).
2. Go to **Window** on the menu bar. Select **Workspaces**. Choose **Reset to Saved Layout**.
