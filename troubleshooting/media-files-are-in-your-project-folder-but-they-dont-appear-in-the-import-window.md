# Media files are in your project folder but they don't appear in the import window

If you copy media files into your project folder after you've opened Premiere, those files might not appear in the Import window when try to bring them into your project. This happens because Premiere needs to refresh its view of your project folder.

* Go to **File** on the menu bar. Select **Save**. You should now see your media files in the Import window. 

If you save your project but your media files still don't appear in the Import window, you'll need to save your project, close Premiere and then reopen your project.
