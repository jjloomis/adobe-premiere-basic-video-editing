# One Panel is Super Large and It's the Only Thing You See in Premiere

This is actually a feature \(not a bug\) that lets you focus on a particular panel. There are two ways to toggle this feature on or off.

* Go to **Window** on the menu bar. Select **Restore Frame Size**.
* Press the **~** key \(on your keyboard.\)
