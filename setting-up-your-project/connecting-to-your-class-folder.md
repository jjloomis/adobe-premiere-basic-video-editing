# Connecting to your class folder

Your Premiere project and all of the media files associated with it will live in your class folder.

* Connect to your class folder using [JAMS Lab](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-jams-lab.html) or [CCL](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-campus-computer-lab.html) Mac.

Note: Connecting to your class folder in a JAMS Lab is recommended. Premiere is a resource-intensive program that may run slower on Campus Computer Lab Macs.
