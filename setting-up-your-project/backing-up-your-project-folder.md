# Backing up your project folder

Be sure to backup your project folder on a regular basis. If anything happens to your project folder SD card, you'll have a backup version in your class folder. 

1. Go the [JAMS Tech Resources for Students](http://uwm.edu/journalism-advertising-media-studies/student-resources/tech-resources/) page. 
2. Click the **Click here to connect to your class folder in a CCL** link \(upper-right.\)
3. Your browser will ask if you would like to proceed. Click the affirmative option \(**Open Finder**, **Yes**, **Launch Application**, etc.\)
4. A dialog box will appear. Click **Connect**. 
5. In the **Finder window**, double-click your **course number folder** and your **Lastname-Firstname** **folder** to navigate into your class folder. 
6. With the **Finder window** still selected, press **Command N** \(on keyboard\) to open a second **Finder window**.
7. In the second **Finder window**, select your **project folder SD card** \(under **Locations** on left.\) Your **project folder SD card** will be named **JAMS** followed by a number. 
8. Click and drag your project folder from your **project folder SD** card into your **class folder**. **Important**: Make sure you click and drag the project from your project folder SD card into your class folder.
9. If you are prompted with a message that asks if you would like to **Replace** or **Merge** the folder, you can select **Merge** \(the merge process takes less time to complete.\)
