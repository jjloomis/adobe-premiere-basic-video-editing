# Connecting to your class folder

Your Premiere project and all of the media files associated with it will live in your class folder.

* Connect to your class folder using JAMS Lab or Campus Computer Lab Mac.

Note: Connecting to your class folder in a JAMS Lab is recommended. Premiere is a resource-intensive program and may run slower in Campus Computer Labs.
