# Creating a script

1. Make sure Premiere and Microsoft Word are open. 
2. While [previewing a clip in the Source monitor](/previewing-media-in-the-source-monitor.md), watch and listen for keeper sound bites. When you find a keeper sound bite, make note of its timecode in Microsoft Word. (Note: The timecode format is: `Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Frames`. Be sure to note the entire timecode.)
