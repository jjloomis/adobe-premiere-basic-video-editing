# Building a story in your sequence

## Audio first

Begin “building” the story by adding audio to the sequence first: narration, sound bites, and natural sound – following the order on your script. Listen to be sure the spacing and pacing sounds natural.

## B-roll next

Add B-roll to “cover” your narration. You may also want to use B-roll to cover edits in sound bites, or make longer sound bites more interesting by covering sections of them with relevant video.
