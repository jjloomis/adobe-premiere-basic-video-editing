# Creating audio automations

Specific areas of your sound bites can be set to automatically become louder or softer in volume as your project plays in the[Multitrack Session](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/adobe-audition-basic-audio-editing/content/GLOSSARY.html#multitrack-session). This automation process is not always necessary, but it is an option if want to create dynamic volume fluctuations at certain points of your project.

To automate the volume of an audio track, you can add keyframes to your sound bites in the[Multitrack Session](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/adobe-audition-basic-audio-editing/content/GLOSSARY.html#multitrack-session). The keyframes will automatically increase or decrease the volume of the sound bites as your project plays.
