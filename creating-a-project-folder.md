# Creating a project folder

You'll create a project folder before you start working in Premiere. All media files that make up your project need to live in this folder along with your Premiere project file \(PRPROJ\).

Important: Never rename, move or delete media files from your project folder. Your PRPROJ file references these files. If the PRPROJ file can't reference a media file, it will appear offline in your project.   

1. Control-click in your class folder. In the fly-out menu, select New Folder.
2. Folllowing JAMS naming conventions, give this folder a name that is indicative of your project.
