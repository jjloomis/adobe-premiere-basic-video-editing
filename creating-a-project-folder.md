# Creating a project folder

Before starting a Premiere project, you'll need to create a project folder. All media files associated with your project will live in this folder along with your Premiere project file \(PRPROJ.\)

Never rename, move or delete the media files in your project folder. Your PRPROJ file references these files. If your PRPROJ file can't locate a media file, it will appear offline in your project.

1. Control-click in your class folder. In the fly-out menu, select New Folder.
2. Give this folder a new name using JAMS naming conventions.
