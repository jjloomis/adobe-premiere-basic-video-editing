# Creating a project folder

Before starting a Premiere project, you'll need to create a project folder. All media files associated with your project will live in this project folder along with your Premiere project file \(PRPROJ.\)

Never rename, move or delete the media files in your project folder. Your PRPROJ file references these files. If your PRPROJ file can't locate a media file, it will appear offline in your project.

1. Connect to your class folder using a [JAMS Lab](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-jams-lab.html) or [Campus Computer Lab](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-ccl.html) Mac.
2. [Drill down in the folder tree](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/navigating-folder-tree.html) until you are in your class folder.
3. Control-click in your class folder. In the fly-out menu, select `New Folder`.
4. Give this folder a new name. Follow [file and folder naming conventions](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/file-and-folder-naming-conventions.html).
