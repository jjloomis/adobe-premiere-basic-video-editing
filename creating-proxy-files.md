# Creating and working with proxy files

Proxy files are compressed versions of your project's uncompressed media files. After creating proxy files, you can toggle your project's timeline to reference these compressed files instead of your original uncompressed files. Doing this will make the editing process run smoother as proxy files use substantially less bandwidth than uncompressed files.
