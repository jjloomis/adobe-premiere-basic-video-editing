# Arranging clips in your sequence

When arranging your clips in your Sequence, the top video track plays in the Program monitor. The topmost clip will therefore be the clip that displays in your finished product video as well.



A sequence has multiple video and audio tracks. You can use these tracks to control 



Although video from the topmost video item displays in the Program window, it is not necessarily the audio of this video clip that gets factored into the finished product. Audio from a different source \(an audio file, a different video clip, etc.\) can play under the footage playing in the topmost video track.

1. Click within the Timeline panel to select it.
2. Make sure the Selection Tool is active in the Tool panel.
3. Click and drag clips in your sequence to rearrange the order in which they appear. 
4. A clip will snap to the clip closest to it. To turn snapping on or off, click the Snap Tool \(or press S on your keyboard.\)
