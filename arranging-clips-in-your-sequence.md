# Arranging clips in your sequence

When arranging your clips in your Sequence, the top video track plays in the Program monitor. The top clip will always be the clip that displays in your finished product video as well.

Although video from the top video track displays in the Program window, audio of this video clip that gets factored into the finished product. Audio from a different source \(an audio file, a different video clip, etc.\) can play under the footage playing in the topmost video track.

1. Click within the Timeline panel to select it.
2. Choose the Selection Tool \(black arrow\) in the Tool panel.
3. Click and drag clips in your sequence to change the order in which they appear. 
4. A clip will snap to the clip closest to it. To turn snapping on or off, click the Snap Tool \(or press S on your keyboard.\)
