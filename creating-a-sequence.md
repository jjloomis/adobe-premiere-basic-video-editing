# Creating a sequence

1. To create a sequence, click and drag a video clip from the Project panel into the Timeline panel. Premiere will create a sequence based on the video and audio settings of the clip. \(You can delete this clip if you don't need it in your sequence.\)
2. Your sequence will have the same name as the clip your brought into the Timeline panel. To rename your sequence, select it in the Project panel and give it a new name.
