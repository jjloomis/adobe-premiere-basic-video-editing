# Creating a sequence

1. To create a sequence, click and drag a video clip from the Project panel into the Timeline panel. Premiere will create a sequence based on the video and audio settings of the clip.
2. This is an easy way to create a sequence, but you probably don't need this entire clip in your sequence. Select the clip in your sequence and press Delete on your keyboard to remove it. 
3. Your sequence will have the same name as the clip your brought into the Timeline panel. To rename your sequence, select it in the Project panel and give it a new name. \(Note: A sequence icon is different from a clip icon in the Project panel.\)
