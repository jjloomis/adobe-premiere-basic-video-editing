# Creating a sequence

1. To create a sequence, click and drag a video clip from the Project panel to the Timeline panel. Note: Be sure to use a video clip. Do not use a still image. Premiere will create a sequence based on the video and audio settings of the clip. Note: If you have clips from different video sources, use a clip from the source that will be used most frequently throughout your Premiere project.
2. Select the clip in your sequence and press `Delete` (on keyboard) to remove it from your sequence. The clip will disappear but the sequence will remain in the Timeline panel.
3. Your sequence will have the same name as the clip used to create it. To rename your sequence, select it in the Project panel and give it a new name. Follow File and Folder Naming Conventions.
